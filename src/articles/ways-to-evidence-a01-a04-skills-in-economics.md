A01-A04 skills checklist for A-level Economics

Core skills Meaning Key ways to evidence skills Targets



A01

Knowledge

&amp;

Understanding



Knowledge

“knowing”



Describing main features of terms/concepts/models, etc.

Outline definitions of terms/concepts/models, etc.

Full definitions of terms/concepts/models, etc.

Stating formulas



Understanding

“meaning”



Giving examples to express meaning

Explaining why a term/concept/method/theory is relevant

Showing what a term/concept/method/theory implies

State a clear rationale for using a term/concept/method/theory



A02

Application



Use of

case study

evidence and

context



Giving examples in case study context

Drawing on specific case study text when answering a question

Using numerical case study data

Carrying out calculations accurately using case study data

Answering in context (e.g. competitive market conditions, etc.)

Presenting a relevant diagram linked to the context

Annotating/adding to a diagram shown in a question

Using your own evidence of appropriate real-world events

Clear contextual focus throughout the written response



A03

Analysis



Breaking

things

down



Different segments/markets/sectors/locations

Different stakeholder groups

External and internal factors

Pros/cons based on A01

Different causes/consequences

Different functions/processes/mechanisms

Current v future, short-term v long-term, static v dynamic



Exploring

relationships

in detail



Use of diagrams for building chains (i.e. diagrammatic analysis)

Explaining a simple chain - e.g. &#39;X&#39; causes &#39;Y&#39; because....

Developing a longer chain - e.g. &#39;X&#39; causes &#39;Y&#39; with knock-on &#39;Z&#39;

Building extended chain - e.g. &#39;X&#39; causes &#39;Y&#39; leading to &#39;Z&#39; then…

Cross-linking chains - &#39;X1 causing &#39;Y1&#39; links to &#39;X2&#39; causing &#39;Y2&#39;

Constructing complex chains - e.g. multiple causes/effects



A04

Evaluation



Making

substantiated

judgements



Use of factors/criteria for constructing judgements

Balanced response (e.g. for and against, more or less, etc.)

Justified judgements (i.e. supported with evidence + analysis)

Use of the “it depends” rule when evaluating

Ending with a clear conclusion that answers the question

Focused response highlighting most important points

Acknowledging qualifying factors/limitations of arguments

Where relevant, proposing alternatives/solutions



Note: 1.) A02+A03 = contextual analysis. A02+A04 = contextual evaluation. 2.) There is obvious overlap between the A0s -

e.g. A01 Knowledge and Understanding would be demonstrated through A03 Analysis; fully developed A04 Evaluation will be

analytical, therefore showing A03 Analysis.
