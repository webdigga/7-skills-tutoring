My tutoring is tailored to the student’s needs. We start with a diagnostic assessment of the student’s progress to date and with a view to identifying the most important factors that need to be addressed for the student to excel in Economics.

Students excel in Economics if they achieve proficiency in seven core skills. Once mastered, students are then tutored on exam technique to secure a high exam grade.

Most students will have already made progress mastering several of the core skills. Literacy, numeracy and subject knowledge would be obvious examples here. But my focus is on tutees gaining a much higher level of attainment of each skill and a well-developed ability to use them in effective ways in the exam hall writing top quality responses to exam questions.

I tutor UK students studying A-level and GCSE courses offered by the examination boards AQA, Edexcel, Eduqas and OCR.

Students living outside the UK are tutored for the A-level Economics course offered by Cambridge International Examinations (CIE). I also tutor UK and overseas students the Standard- and Higher-level Economics modules in the International Baccalaureate
Diploma programme (IBD).

I offer both home and online tutoring sessions. Tuition at the student’s home is preferred by most parents, though some opt for a mix of home and online tuition.
