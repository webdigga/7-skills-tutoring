Students studying A-level Business are provided with customised tuition geared to their specific learning needs.

I start with a diagnostic assessment of learner’s progress to date to identify the most important issues that need addressing for the student to achieve their best in the exam hall.

One key focus of my tutoring is to ensure students fully master all the topics in their course syllabus, meaning that they not only know the topics (e.g. definitions) but are also very confident in using them to show real depth of understanding in their written work.

Another often needed focus of tutoring is in supporting students to produce higher quality responses to exam questions. Evidence of well-developed contextualised analysis and contextualised evaluation in their written work are key requirements for securing a high A-level grade.

I attach considerable importance to ensuring tutees have sound knowledge and understanding of the financial fundamentals of real businesses (e.g. revenue streams, profitability, balance sheet strength, liquidity, etc.) as these lie at the heart of understanding past, present and future business performance.

Much emphasis is placed on using real world businesses and markets as much as possible in my tutoring. This case study approach is the most effective way to leverage deep learning quickly.

Using real world businesses makes mastering A-level Business more interesting and exciting, and which invariably inspires students to write to a much higher standard, especially when covering the more advanced business strategy topics such as Porter’s Five Forces Model of Competition and Porter’s Generic Strategies.
