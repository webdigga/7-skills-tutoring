Students studying A-level Business are provided with customised tuition geared to their specific learning needs.

I start with a diagnostic assessment of student progress to date and with a view to identifying the most important issues that need addressing for the student to achieve their target exam grade.

Having taught and tutored students the AQA, Edexcel and Eduqas A-level Business courses over many years, I know all the topics that need to be mastered in detail and the best exam technique to deploy for achieving a high grade in each of their exam papers.

Written responses to past exam questions is a key area which I work with students on throughout my time tutoring them, especially for evidencing the ‘higher order’ skills of analysis and evaluation.

For me, best practice tutoring of A-level Business must also include expert tuition on mastering business financial fundamentals (e.g. revenue streams, profitability, balance sheet strength, cash flow, etc.) as these lie at the heart of understanding business performance and the non-financial factors affecting them.

It is also important to factor into tutoring case studies of real businesses, especially ones that students have prior knowledge of (often as consumers themselves), as well as other firms which tutees might not know about but could easily understand.

Using real world businesses as aids makes mastering A-level Business more interesting and exciting, and invariably inspires students to write to a much higher standard, especially when covering business strategy topics such as Porter’s Five Forces Model of Competition, Porter’s Generic Strategies, etc..
