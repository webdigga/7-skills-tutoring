## Tutoring with core skills in mind

We start with a diagnostic assessment of learner’s progress to date to identify the most important issues that need addressing for the student to achieve their best in the exam hall. One key focus of my tutoring is to ensure students fully master all the topics in their course syllabus, meaning that they not only know the topics (e.g. definitions) but are also very confident in using them to show real depth of understanding in their written work.

## Supporting students produce high quality written work

Evidence of well-developed contextualised analysis and contextualised evaluation in students written work are key requirements for securing a high A-level grade. I attach considerable importance to ensuring tutees have a very good grasp of the financial fundamentals of real businesses (e.g. revenue streams, profitability, balance sheet strength, liquidity, etc.) as this then helps them to write with greater confidence to a higher standard.

## Tutoring using real world case studies of businesses and markets

This case study approach is the most effective way to leverage deep learning quickly. Using real world businesses makes mastering A-level Business more interesting and exciting, and which invariably inspires students to write to a much higher standard, especially when covering the more advanced business strategy topics such as Porter’s Five Forces Model of Competition and Porter’s Generic Strategies.
