Firms in a perfectly competitive market are earning \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ profits at price P1. At this price individual firms will be faced with a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__price elastic demand curve AR1=MR1. Given that firms are profit maximisers (MR1=MC), they will each be producing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_output at price P1, thus making supernormal profit (AR1>AC).

**\* Missing words: supernormal, Q1, perfectly**

<img src="/_includes/static/img/screenshot-2024-11-22-17.12.03.webp" alt="Figure 1: A firm earning supernormal profit in the short-run in a perfectly competitive market." title="Figure 1: A firm earning supernormal profit in the short-run in a perfectly competitive market." class="Centre" width="600px" height="450px" loading="lazy"/>

The prospect of earning profit will encourage the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of new firms into the market driven by the profit motive. Firms can do this easily and without cost because there are no \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to entry in the long run. This will cause a rightward \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__in the market supply curve from S1 to \_\_\_\_\_. Ceteris paribus, this forces down the ruling market price from P1 to P2. As a result, the market price that individual firms can obtain \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ because their perfectly price elastic demand curves fall from AR1=MR1 to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\___.

**\* Missing words: shift, decreases, AR2=MR2, barriers, entry, S2**

As can be seen in the diagram, the new market equilibrium price P2 equals the average cost of production for firms. These firms are still profit-maximising (MR=MC) but are now only earning \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ profit (AR=AC). In effect, the supernormal profit has been \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_away by the entry of new firms into the industry. Ceteris paribus, there will be no further \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for movement of firms in and out of the industry, thus a long-run \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ has been established where price \_\_\_\_\_ = average cost AC2 at output \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ where MR2=MC2.

**\* Missing words: incentive, P2, normal, competed, Q2, equilibrium**

The diagram also shows that at the long-run equilibrium price of P2 and output Q2, perfectly competitive firms are both \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_efficient (AC=MC) and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_efficient (P2=MC). In effect, firms are producing the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\__ profit-maximising output possible at the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-price which consumers are \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to pay.

**\* Missing words: allocatively, maximum, willing, cheapest, productively, able**
