## Planning top quality essays to achieve A*-A grade marks

The essay plan shown below can used for the 25-mark essay questions in AQA, Edexcel and OCR exam papers, and for the equivalent 20-mark essay questions in Eduqas and WJEC exam papers. Note that the plan provides for featuring two main arguments (i.e. first point and second point each with supporting contextual analysis and contextual evaluation). Some teachers suggest factoring in more than two arguments. This is only advisable if your two main arguments do not contain sufficient contextual analysis and evaluation.
