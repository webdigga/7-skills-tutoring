## Core skills to evidence in A-level Economics exams

This is a multi-purpose checklist. The right-hand column is used for selecting key targets for students to focus on when drafting written work.

As a basic minimum guide, all students should be able to tick at least two targets for each of the A01-A04 core skills shown.

More advanced students might focus on specific core skills to develop and fine tune such as A3 Analysis (e.g. “Use of diagrams for building chains”, “Building extended chains”, etc.) and/or A04 Evaluation (e.g. Use of factors/criteria for constructing judgments, etc.).

All students should read the two footnotes at the bottom of the page.

<img src="/_includes/static/img/a03.avif" alt="A03 - Analysis" title="A03 - Analysis" class="Centre" width="1050px" height="420px" loading="lazy"/>

<img src="/_includes/static/img/a04.avif" alt="A04 - Evaluation" title="A04 - Evaluation" class="Centre" width="1050px" height="259px" loading="lazy"/>

\* Note: 1.) A02+A03 = contextual analysis. A02+A04 = contextual evaluation. 2.) There is obvious overlap between the A0s - e.g. A01 Knowledge and Understanding could be demonstrated through A03 Analysis; fully developed A04 Evaluation will be analytical, therefore showing A03 Analysis.
